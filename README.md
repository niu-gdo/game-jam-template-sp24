Then, open the repository and `git checkout starting-template`.
2. Open Unity Hub and select the 'Open -> Existing Project' button. Select the newly downloaded repository to add it to Unity Hub.
3. You're all set.

Once the starter branch is downloaded, you will be able to start off the tutorial with all of the packages and art assets needed- allowing you to dive straight into development.
